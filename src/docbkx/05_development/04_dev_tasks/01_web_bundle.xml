	<title>Creating a new web bundle</title>
	
	<para>
	Most development tasks are straight forward, plain <application>Eclipse PDE</application> development.
	However, due to the fact that the Jetty setup with JSP is a bit tricky, creating a new bundle
	which provided a new web controller requires a few extra steps.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	First create a plain new OSGi project (<guimenuitem>Plug-in Project</guimenuitem>) and then convert the project
	to the <quote>faceted form</quote> using <guimenuitem>Convert to Faceted Formâ€¦</guimenuitem> in the sub-menu 
	<guimenu>Configure</guimenu> of the context menu of this project. Select to have only the <quote>Java</quote>
	and <quote>Dynamic web project</quote> facet active. Be sure that you enable Java 8 for both the
	Plugin project settings and the Java Facet. You can delete the <filename>WebContent</filename> directory
	which was created. It is not used. 
	</para>
	
	<note><title>WEB-INF directory</title>
	<para>
	There will be a second <filename>WEB-INF</filename> directory created under <filename>WebContent</filename>.
	<emphasis>Do not</emphasis> use this directory. Jetty will ignore it. If you need a <filename>WEB-INF</filename>
	directory, then it must be in the root of the bundle.
	</para>
	</note>
	
	<para>
	Next edit the <filename>MANIFEST.MF</filename> and add the following attributes:
	<programlisting><![CDATA[Eclipse-BundleShape: dir]]></programlisting>
	This will tell Maven Tycho to tell P2 to unpack the bundle when installing. This is required so that Jetty
	can find the JSP pages later on.
	</para>
