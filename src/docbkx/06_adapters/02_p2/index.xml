	<title>P2 repository adapter</title>
	
	<para>
	   The Eclipse P2 repository adapter allows one to consume OSGi artifacts from
	   Package Drone using the P2 repository system (see also <link xlink:href="https://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/" />). 
	</para>
	
	<note>
	   <title>Channel aspects</title>
	   <para>
	       For this repository adapter to work the channel needs P2 metadata. This can either
	       be uploaded by a Maven Tycho build, or can be created on the fly by Package Drone
	       through adding the <quote>OSGi</quote> and <quote>P2 Metadata</quote> channel aspect.
	   </para>
	</note>
	
    <para>
	    The base entry point for this adapter is <uri>http://localhost:8080/p2</uri>. The first
	    path parameter is the channel ID or name. So in order to install from the channel <filename>mtest1</filename>
	    use the following URI:
	    <screen>
	    http://localhost:8080/p2/mtest1
	    </screen>
    </para>
    
    <note>
        <title>P2 installation dialog</title>
        <para>
            Although the P2 system can handle bundle only installs, the P2 installation dialog and target platform editor cannot.
            These require at least a feature or category. If the P2 metadata is created by Package Drone is is
            possible to create virtual features and categories. 
        </para>
